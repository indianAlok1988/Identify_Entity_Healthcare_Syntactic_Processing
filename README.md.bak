Deep Learning Course Project- Gesture Recognition

Problem Statement:
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of 
the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five 
different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

•Thumbs up		:  Increase the volume.
•Thumbs down	:  Decrease the volume.
•Left swipe		:  'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
•Right swipe	:  'Jump' forward 10 seconds. 
•Stop			:  Pause the movie. 

Objective:
Our task is to train different models on the 'train' folder to predict the action performed in each
sequence or video and which performs well on the 'val' folder as well. The final test folder for 
evaluation is withheld - final model's performance will be tested on the 'test' set.
